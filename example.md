Dear Stanford University admissions,

After careful consideration of the rejection you submitted this March,
it is with utmost regret that I must inform you that I am unable to
accept your rejection at this time.

Please understand that this is in no way a judgment or evaluation of
your particular rejection. I have received many promising and worthy
rejections such as yours this year, and I am therefore unable to accept
every qualified rejection.

This decision was made only after extensive and careful deliberation by
a panel of experts well versed in matters of self-worth, anxiety, and
na√Øve understandings of fairness. Therefore, my decision is final and I
must ask that you refrain from contacting me with appeals.

I sincerely wish you luck in your other rejections, and have confidence
that you will be successful in all your future endeavors.

I look forward to seeing you on campus in the fall.

Sincerely,
